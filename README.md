# realtyapi

Standard crud service for our realty application.

POSTGRES DB requires ssl connection

DO not publish password information here...in future commits the parameters 
will be read as env variables/vm options/program arguments whichever seems to be most effective

This app uses Spring Webflux, which is a reactive implementation of SPRING MVC, I just like using it more
